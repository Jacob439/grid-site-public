# grid-site
This is a project I created that allows users to paint tiles on a canvas with other users.

## Key features:
- Live Collaboration
     - Multiple users can work on the same canvas in real-time
- Unique URL Creation
     - Every new canvas can only be accessed by a unique URL
     - This allows for users to create their own private canvas to share with friends
- View History
     - The entire history of the canvas is recorded and can be viewd using the "View History" button
